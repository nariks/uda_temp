Feature #1 - Save the list to a file when new item is added, update the file when an item is deleted or item status is changed, and prints from the file when print_list is requested after checking file exists.

Feature #2 - Check item ID(index) validity to see if it exists before deleting or updating status of an item.

Feature #3 - Prints tick mark and cross for completion status instead of true or false for better readability of the list.
